# Classes, Objects, and their Members
- Methods encapsulate the software's business logic and algorithms
- Constructors help with constructing/creating objects
- Objects are always created from classes

## Classes & Objects
- An object has both *state* and *behavior*
    - State: the metadata about a particular object (e.g. the "John" object is `29` years old)
        - State comprises variables
        - State:Variables
    - Behavior: the things a particular object can do (e.g. the "John" object can *register* for a course)
    - (Registering for a course would be a *method*)
    - Behavior:Methods
- Classes are like blueprints & objects are the instantiations of a class
    - Can have nested classes & nested interfaces, too
- Class "members" are either variables or methods
- Class structure:
    - Classes start w/variable declarations (e.g. id, name, gender)
    - Then comes the method definitions (e.g. `updateProfile`)
- When you initialize an object w/specific values for its variables, you initialize/"set" its *state*
    - You'd use the `.` operator to do this (e.g. `s.id = 10;` for the variable `s`)
- When you use a method on an object, you are "invoking" or "calling" the method on the object
